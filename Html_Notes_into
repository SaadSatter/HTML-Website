HTML Notes: 
**Open ur website by clicking the index inside file explorer, 
    Or copy file path to browser
**Although some styling options are available in HTML via attributes 
    you should refrain from using them and only style with CSS and JS



<center> - centers all elements below it
<h#></h#>- is to make headers
    they get smaller for higher numbers 
<br>- this is a new line command that is within or outside of other tags
    ex. <h2>By <br> Saad Satter </h2>
<hr>- this creates a horizontal line, due to default CSS, it looks weird
    depending on placement 
<!-- --> : this is how to make comments in html
HTML Attributes:
    Attributes allow to give more information to the browser to give 
    modification. Go to the documentation to see what modifications are allowed
    Ex.
        <hr size = "3" noshade>

index.html : for a full html website, it indicates the main page 

<!DOCTYPE html> : tells the browser what html and file is being used 
<html></html> : tells the browser that everything in it is html
<head></head> : anything in here will not be displayed in the website
    instead it gives information about the website such as title and meta
<title></title> : this is NOT domain name, this is NOT text, 
    this is simply the name of the website you'll on top of the tab

<meta>: tags always go inside the <head> element, and are
 typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, 
 author of the document, and viewport settings.
    <meta charset = ""> : tells the browser the type of text that is 
        allowed on the website. This is important when dealing with 
        different languages as different languages have a different set of 
        standard symbols. 
        "utf-8" is standard unicode, works for a lot of symbols and emoji
    <meta description = ""> : tells the browser the description for the
        website when looking it up on google and stuff

<body></body> : this is where text and stuff can be displayed 
<p></p> : the p tag is a paragraph tag that makes a new line and groups 
    texts

<em></em> vs <i></i> : visually the same but em gives more emphasis 
    and conveys more information, therefore it is better to use
    **Same applies with <strong></strong> vs <b></b> for bold

Lists:
    SIMPLE: Simplest is using the ul tag to tell the browser that the 
    contents within the tag is a list, and the li tag is each bullet point of the 
    list 
        Ex.
        <ul> : ul means unordered list so it uses bullet points
            <li></li>  : li means list
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        NESTED: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        Ordered: uses 1. 2. 3. style as a list by default, but you can
            use the type attribute to change the ordered style. 
            You can also use the start attribute to determine which 
            number it should start at
            You can also mix types of list
        Ex.
        <ol type = "A" start = "C">
           <li>
                <ul>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
           </li> 
        </ol>
<img src="" alt=""> : The src is the image address from online 
    OR You can put an image in the same folder of your project and
    give the file name
        and the
        alt attribute displays a text when the image cannot be rendered 
        by the website

<a href=""></a> : anchor tag that links a text to a hyper link
        The href attribute is the url to the link
        ex. <a href="https://animixplay.to/anime/48556/Takt_Op_Destiny">
            Takt Infinity
        </a>

Tables: used to make cleaner structures
<table></table> : The table tag can help structure your text into columns
        and boxes and you can remove the border for an overall cleaner 
        look.
        <tr></tr> : table row and structures by default top to bottom
        <td></td> : table data or table cell element which is placed
            in columns by default form left to right
        <th></th> : table header, gives a header for columns
        Modularize Your Table: Theoretically you can make your rows and
            cells and header and footer all in the same <table></table>
            element, but you want to modularize it so that you can style
            the head and body and footer differently if you so choose
        <thead></thead> : header for the table and within it you can
            make the individual column heads using <th></th>
        <tbody></tbody>: table body 
        <tfoot></tfoot> : table footer

Forms: Forms can take in information but html is only for structure, 
        therefore it cannot do anything on its own for the functionality
        of a form. It can place a form and take in input but JS is needed
        to make any use of it.
        <form action="" class="" method=""></form>: the form tag doesn't
            display anything, it is simply the body for holding the form 
        <label for="">Mylabel</label>: this is the label for your question.
            Labels and inputs are all on the same line by default
        <input type="text"> : this shows that you will take in an input for 
            your form. The type attribute specifies that it is a text.
        <input type="submit"> : the submit type generates a submit button
            next to the input
        types: different types of input 
            text : takes in a string 
            submit : a submit button input
            color: prompts a color wheel to choose a color 
            checkbox: shows a checkbox
            password: anything typed in here is masked 
            email: they can write in an email
            file: allows user to upload a file
        <textarea name="" id="" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>:
            gives the user an area of text to write a message. You can 
            change the area of the message by rows and cols
